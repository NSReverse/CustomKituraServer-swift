# CustomKituraServer-swift
This is my take on a simple webserver built on IBM's Kitura

I built this project for the fun of learning something new and practicing on my Swift.

This server takes in a simple web structure on the form of:
- public_html/
  - css/
    - common.css
  - js/
    - common.js
  - index.html
  
The public_html folder must be on the same level of the executable.
